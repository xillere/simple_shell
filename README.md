## 0x16. C - Simple Shell

## Group project

### Introduction
This project takes a deep dive into the world of shell. Here I am able to create my own simple shell which can take in commands very similarly or otherwise exactly like other shells such as the thompson shell, unix shell or better still the bash(born again shell). Here a lot of c function and system calls are utilized.

This project takes a wide scope on all the previous ALX projects and utilizes them.
